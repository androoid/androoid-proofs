== Library Proof

Thanks for checking out Androoid Library Proof from Git.

This guide allows developers to deploy Androoid Library Proof from source
code on their own devices.

Download Androoid Library Proof source code from Git using:

  git clone https://github.com/androoid/androoid-proofs.git
  cd androoid-proofs/LibraryProof

If you prefer to test this Library Proof application, you could download it
from link:#https://play.google.com/store/apps[Google Play]

=== Pre-Requisites

To execute this Android proof application on your own device from source code,
is necessary to have:

* Maven 3.0.5+
* Android SDK 21
* Define $ANDROID_HOME variable in your PATH system

Also, yo need to generate a key store to sign generated .apk

==== Generate Key Store

Key store is a password-protected file that contains public/private key pairs used for JAR signatures. Protect this key. If you lose it, you wonâ€™t be able to update your app.

  keytool -genkey -v -keystore android.keystore -alias android-keystore -keyalg RSA -validity 10000 -storepass PASSWORD1 -keypass PASSWORD2

=== Execution 

==== Generating signed release APK using Maven

Define two system variables for the keystore file and alias:

  export ANDROID_KEYSTORE=<path>
  export ANDROID_KEYALIAS=<alias>

Now, you can generate the signed and zipaligned release APK using the Maven task:

  mvn clean package -Dsign.keystore=~/android.keystore -Dsign.alias=android-keystore -Dsign.storepass=PASSWORD1 -Dsign.keypass=PASSWORD2
